
In this section we describe the experimental design we setup to evaluate the impact that the multicollinearity and distribution of the input variables have on the DEA efficiency estimates. 
Since the analysis relies on the generation of synthetic data, 
we start by describing the data generation process, 
and then introduce the factors and response variables in the experimental design. 

\subsection{Data Generation}
We setup a data generation process according to a production set $\Psi$ as defined  in the previous section. 
To this end we make use of a Cobb-Douglas production function~\cite{Douglas1997}, 
which has been found to adequately describe production functions in many economic sectors
\SAB{(recent reference - pending)}. 



\subsection{Factors}
The experiment consist of six factors, as we describe in the following.
